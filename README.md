### 🔍 Overview  
**Network Topology Simulator** is a Python-based interactive tool to visualize and simulate computer network topologies.  
It allows users to **create nodes (routers, switches, PCs)**, connect them dynamically, and visualize **real-time packet flow** through animated transmission.  

Built using **Tkinter**, **NetworkX**, and **Matplotlib**, this simulator helps learners understand **network structure, routing paths, and data transmission** in an intuitive way.

### ⚙️ Features  
- 🖱️ **Interactive GUI:** Add, move, and connect nodes dynamically.  
- 🌐 **Multiple Node Types:** Routers, switches, and PCs represented with emoji-based icons and hover tooltips.  
- 📡 **Animated Packet Flow:** Visualize live data packets traveling across the network.  
- 🪟 **Packet Monitor Window:** Shows real-time updates for source, destination, and hops.  
- 🧠 **Shortest Path Calculation:** Uses graph algorithms to determine optimal routing.  
- 💾 **Save & Load Topologies:** Store complex layouts and reload them anytime.
